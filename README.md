## Introduction
This Number System Converter is a comprehensive tool developed to facilitate the conversion between different numeral systems. As a project crafted with dedication by a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student, this is mainly designed to help you in your revisions in courses that require converting between different numeral systems such as Digital Systems Design, etc.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy to navigate command-line interface for smooth conversion processes.
- **Multiple Conversions:** Support for converting between binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal number systems.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures the correctness of input data with checks, preventing incorrect conversions.

## How to Use
1. **Compile the Program:** Use a C compiler such as GCC to compile the source code. For example, `gcc number_system_converter.c -o converter -lm` to include the math library.
2. **Run the Program:** Execute the compiled program. On Windows, run `converter.exe`, or on Unix/Linux, run `./converter`.
3. **Follow the Prompts:** Choose the type of conversion you wish to perform and enter the number according to the instructions.

## Conversions Supported
The Number System Converter supports the following conversions:
- Binary to Decimal, Octal, and Hexadecimal
- Decimal to Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal
- Octal to Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal
- Hexadecimal to Binary, Decimal, and Octal

## Building and Running
To build and run the Number System Converter, you will need a C compiler (like GCC) and a basic understanding of terminal or command prompt commands. Detailed steps are provided in the [How to Use](#how-to-use) section.
